# LAR@MSL Player Code (OmniVision)

## Why Golang?
Main reasons:
- Fast;
- Easy to learn;
- Simple thread system.

# OmniVision_pkg
Use only the omnidirectional camera to self-localization and objects detection. 
[OmniVision Documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/josecomartins/OmniVision/blob/main/Player/OmniVision_pkg/OmniVisionDoc/pkg/player/OmniVision_pkg/index.html#/bored)

# python
Python gRPC server. Capture the image and streams to Golang the image and the YOLO data.

# pb
Code generated by gRPC automatically.
The gRPC services and structs are defined in "message.proto"

# Other modules:
## Communication
Communication is used like a local database. Communicates with ESP32 (low level) and BaseStation (high level).

## Freenect
Library to adquire images from Kinect.

## Skills
Use kinect camera as primary data source and performe all individual skills.

## GoalKeeper
GoalKeeper will be responsible for the prediction of the ball trajectory and obtaind Goalkeeper position using a LIDAR.


# Run
## Run Calibration
Open the Calibration Tool.
> $ make calib

## gRPC Generate 
Generate the code to Python and Golang can use gRPC.
> $ make gen_grpc

## Record 
Record cameras data.
> $ make record

## Run Server 
Open Python gRPC server.
> $ make server

## Run Go
Compile and start Golang.
> $ make debug

## Run All
Start the server and Golang.
> $ make start
