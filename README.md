# OmniVision_pkg

## Self-localization
The self-localization is made through template match.
We develop tow types of localization "Global" that search the position in all field and "Close" that search just in near area.

## Object Detection
This algorithm will be able to detect all elements in the field: goal posts, ball, robots, humans.
⚠️Until now we just develop a simple threshold method, to other member of the team can develope Skill and Strategy.
We are integrating Instance Segmentation using YOLOv8 in our code. Results soon...
